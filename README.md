Wind speed:

Changes to mean wind speed and wind speed distribution

90% percentile

Analyse if there are regional differences (for one RCM Tabelle?)

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS

Solar radiation:

Changes to daily cycle

Analyse if there are regional differences

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS

Capacity factor Wind:

Difference between number of timesteps under 20% capacity when using two different wind turbines profiles (3.3 MW and 5MW)

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS

Dunkelflaute:

Changes to the overall frequency/percentage of Dunkelflauten

Check if the distribution of these events throughout the year is focused mostly on Winter like in previous studies reported.

Event duration: calculate distributions of consecutive hours/days below combined wind & solar thresholds.

Analyse if there are regional differences

Covariation metrics: compute correlation coefficients (or mutual information) between wind speed and solar irradiance on event days.

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS
