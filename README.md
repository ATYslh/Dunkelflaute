Wind speed (and similar things for the other variables):
------
Changes to mean wind speed and wind speed distribution (Plot staircase, comparison of mean between datasets?)

95%/10% percentile changes (plot map)

Analyse if there are regional differences (changes between scenarios and historical with timmean)

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS (fldmean table)

Seasonal change? (for all of the other points)

Changes to daily cycle (plot just Germany for all seasons?, doing this for all data sets would be too much. How would I even compare numbers here?)

Dunkelflaute:
-------
Changes to the overall frequency/percentage of Dunkelflauten

Check if the distribution of these events throughout the year is focused mostly on Winter like in previous studies reported.

Event duration: calculate distributions of consecutive hours/days below combined wind & solar thresholds.

Analyse if there are regional differences

Covariation metrics: compute correlation coefficients (or mutual information) between wind speed and solar irradiance on event days.

Check difference between RCMS/GCMS
